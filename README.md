# Hello!

## Description
-Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find several different projects that I have been working on throughout my time learning how to code!

## Different features of the landing page
- In my navbar, when you click each link it will take you to the corresponding section of the page of the link you clicked.
- There are 5 different projects that I have listed for your pleasure to observe!
- When you hover over each image the opacity changes and when you click the link it will open in a new tab.
- So far I only have one project, however, that will get updated as I work on more projects.
- In my footer, you can see all the different ways to reach me!
- I have left my twitter and LinkedIn links set to direct to nothing as I have not set those profiles up yet, but as soon as I have those the links will get updated
- I am still working through some issues will the flex box of my site that I hope to resolve in the near future.
